# Summary
System to transfer surgical tool container into an autoclave for sterilization.

# How It Was Made
The project was created in IDLE Python and implemented into a prebuilt Quanser Interactive Labs virtual environment.

# Game Description
The program starts by making the arm pick up the first spawned container. The right potentiometer is controlled by the user to rotate the base of the arm to the correct autoclave. The left potentiometer is then used to tell the program to place the container inside or on top of the autoclave. The autoclaves are then closed and turned on to facilitate tool sterilization. The program will repeat this cycle until all 6 containers have been placed in their corresponding drop-off location.
